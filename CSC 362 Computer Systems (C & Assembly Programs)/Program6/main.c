//  This program uses a "first fit" strategy to place a collection of various weighted items into a group of bins of equal capacity.
//  We pick an item, start with the first bin, and look through each consecutive bin until we find one that can hold the item.
//  Items are placed inside the bins in alphabetical order by name.
//  The strategy is implemented using "bin" structs, each with its own linked list of "node" structs for the items.

struct node {

    struct node *nodes; // front of linked list of items in bin
};

// prototypes for functions
